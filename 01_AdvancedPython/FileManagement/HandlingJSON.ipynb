    "## Project: Financial Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "To understand, analyze, and derive insights from the financial data of various clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Loading and Exploration**:\n",
    "    - Load the JSON data into a Python environment.\n",
    "    - Display the first 5 records to understand the structure of the data.\n",
    "    - Determine the number of clients in the dataset.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Basic Data Analysis**:\n",
    "    - Calculate the total budget, expenses, revenue, and profit across all clients.\n",
    "    - Determine the average budget, expenses, revenue, and profit per client.\n",
    "    - Identify the client with the highest and lowest profit.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Advisor Analysis**:\n",
    "    - List all unique financial advisors in the dataset.\n",
    "    - Determine the number of clients each advisor handles.\n",
    "    - Identify the advisor managing the client with the highest profit.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Budget Analysis**:\n",
    "    - Identify clients whose actual expenses exceeded their budget.\n",
    "    - Determine the total amount by which the budget was exceeded for these clients.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Profit Margin Analysis**:\n",
    "    - Calculate the profit margin for each client (Profit Margin = Profit / Revenue).\n",
    "    - Rank clients based on their profit margins, from highest to lowest.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Visualization**:\n",
    "    - Plot a bar chart showing the profit of each client.\n",
    "    - Plot a pie chart showing the distribution of clients among different financial advisors.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Advanced Analysis (Optional)**:\n",
    "    - Group clients based on profit ranges (e.g., 0-10k, 10k-20k, etc.) and determine the number of clients in each range.\n",
    "    - Identify any correlations between budget allocation and actual profit.\n",
    "    - Predict the next year's profit for each client based on their current data (this would require some basic regression techniques).\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Data Export**:\n",
    "    - Save the analyzed data, including any new columns or calculations, into a new JSON file.\n",
    "    - Export a subset of the data (e.g., top 5 profitable clients) into a CSV file.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips:\n",
    "- Use Python libraries such as `pandas` for data manipulation and `matplotlib` or `seaborn` for visualization.\n",
    "- Always validate your results by cross-checking with the original data.\n",
    "- Document your observations and insights as you progress through the exercises.\n",
